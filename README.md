This repository documents my Python problem‑solving journey on HackerRank, where I earned a 5 Star Python Badge by consistently solving coding challenges across core 
Python concepts such as data types, conditional logic, loops, functions, strings, sets, dictionaries, and problem-solving techniques. The uploaded badge screenshot 
serves as verified proof of my proficiency and consistent performance on the platform. This achievement reflects my strong logical thinking, coding efficiency, 
and ability to write optimized and readable Python solutions under competitive programming constraints, further strengthening my foundation for real‑world data analysis 
and software development tasks.
